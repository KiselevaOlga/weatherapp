# My Awesome Blog Post

This is the title of my blog post, written with Markdown!

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to create formatted text documents. It's easy to learn and widely used for writing things like:

- Blog posts
- Readme files
- Documentation
- And more!

This post will demonstrate some basic Markdown features.

## Headings

There are six levels of headings, created using one to six hash symbols (#).

- This is an H1 heading (largest)
- This is an H2 heading
- ## This is an H3 heading

## Bold, Italics, and Strikethrough

You can format text using:

- **Bold:** Wrap text with two asterisks (\*) or underscores (\_)
- _Italics:_ Wrap text with one asterisk (\*) or underscore (\_)
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Wrap text with two tildes (~)

**This text is bold.**

_This text is italicized._

~~This text is strikethrough.~~

## Lists

Create unordered lists with asterisks (\*) or hyphens (-), and ordered lists with numbers:

- Coffee
- Tea
- Chocolate
- Ice cream

1. Buy groceries
2. Cook dinner
3. Watch a movie

## Code Blocks

Use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks:

```python
def my_function(x):
  return x * 2
```
